            "Answer: Agent AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can perceive its environment, learn from it, and then take actions or make decisions to achieve specific goals.  Unlike passive AI systems that simply analyze data or respond to queries, agent AI exhibits a degree of autonomy and proactivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown of key characteristics:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Autonomous Operation:** Agent AI operates with a degree of independence, making decisions and taking actions without constant human intervention.\n",
            "* **Goal-Oriented:** These agents are designed with specific objectives in mind, and their actions are directed towards achieving those goals.\n",
            "* **Adaptive Learning:** Agent AI can learn from its experiences and adjust its behavior to improve its performance over time.  This learning can be through various methods like reinforcement learning.\n",
            "* **Interactive:** Agents interact with their environment, which can be a virtual world, a physical space, or a data stream. They perceive information from the environment and act upon it.\n",
            "* **Reactive and Proactive:** They can react to changes in their environment and also proactively take steps to achieve their goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Examples of Agent AI:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Self-driving cars:**  These use sensors to perceive the environment and make decisions about steering, acceleration, and braking to navigate safely.\n",
            "* **Chatbots:**  Advanced chatbots can learn user preferences and proactively offer assistance or information.\n",
            "* **Trading bots:**  These agents analyze market data and automatically execute trades to maximize profits.\n",
            "* **Video game AI:**  Non-player characters (NPCs) in games can exhibit complex behaviors, adapting to player actions and pursuing their own objectives.\n",
            "* **Robotics:**  Robots equipped with AI can perform tasks in the physical world, learning from their interactions and adapting to changing conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Differences from other AI:**\n",
            "\n",
            "While related to other AI concepts, Agent AI is distinct:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Machine Learning (ML):** ML is a *tool* that Agent AI can *use* to learn.  Agent AI is about the overall architecture and behavior, while ML is a specific technique.\n",
            "* **Deep Learning (DL):**  Similar to ML, DL is a specific technique that can be used by Agent AI.\n",
            "* **Expert Systems:** While also goal-oriented, expert systems typically rely on pre-defined rules, whereas Agent AI can learn and adapt.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "In short, Agent AI represents a more sophisticated and autonomous form of artificial intelligence, capable of acting independently and learning from its experiences to achieve defined goals.\n"
